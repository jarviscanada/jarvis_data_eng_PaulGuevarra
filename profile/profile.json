      "description": "Created an application in a team to keep track of users' spending habits and gas consumption. This was developed using Android Studio and Java, and Google Firebase. The features of the application included a secure authentication system keeping track of username and passwords in the firebase database, a map that tracks the users' location and display nearby gas stations and recording different metrics and information of the car's model and gas consumption.",

We compared the accuracy of the algorithms used in order to recommend a song to a user.",

      "description": "Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that is used to record and monitor nodes/server hardware specifications and resource usage. The project was implemented on Linux CentOS 7, using a docker container running PostgreSQL. Created a RDMS database to record and analyze each node's information such as hostname, host's CPU number, total memory free, disk I/O, CPU MHz, etc. Created a crontab to run a bash script every minute to record data into the database. Created SQL queries used against the database to detect any potential host failures and average memory usage of each host.",

        "Twitter App: The twitter CRUD Application is a Java application that allows the user to post, retrieve, and delete Tweets on a Twitter Developer Account. This is accomplished using the official Twitter REST APIs. The application's design is based on the MVC architecture, consisting of a controller layer, service layer, data access object layer (DAO), and a model. The application was implemented using Java, Maven, Twitter REST APIs, HTTP \u0026 JSON, JUnit and Mockito, Spring, and Docker.",
        "JDBC App: Implemented a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) application, that is used to create and establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The application allows the client to perform predefined operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), against the database. The application was implemented using Java, JDBC, Maven, PostgreSQL, and Docker. ",
        "Grep App: Designed a Java Application that replicates the Linux grep command, searching files in a directory, matching strings within the files (using regex), and output matches in another file. The application was implemented with Java 8's Lambda and Stream APIs, Maven, and containerized using Docker. "
